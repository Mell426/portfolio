<h2> Bio</h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;">I am from and live in Washington D.C. I attend Mckinley Tech, a stem highschool. My most favorite thing to is run track. It's basically my hobby becuase that's what i do all year around. I've grown a passion for it the last 4 years. Track is probably one of the most toughest sports but that's why i love it so much, far from easy and competitive.
